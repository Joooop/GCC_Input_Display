# GCC_Input_Display
A browser based input display for Gamecube Controllers. Uses HTML5 gamepad API.

Working version here: https://joemar.me/software/gcc/index.html

This input display has only been tested for Mayflash Gamecube Adapters on PC mode. HTML5 Gamepad API seems to not support adapters in Wii U mode.

Apologies for somewhat messy code, this was only meant to be a small personal project.
